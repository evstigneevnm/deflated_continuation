/*
template<class T, class Container = std::deque<T>> 
class queue;
        
        

The std::queue class is a container adapter that gives the programmer the functionality of a queue - 
specifically, a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure.

The class template acts as a wrapper to the underlying container - only a specific set of functions is provided. 
The queue pushes the elements on the back of the underlying container and pops them from the front.
Template parameters
T   -   The type of the stored elements. The behavior is undefined if T is not the same type as Container::value_type. (since C++17)
Container   -   The type of the underlying container to use to store the elements. The container must satisfy the requirements of SequenceContainer. Additionally, it must provide the following functions with the usual semantics:

    back()
    front()
    push_back()
    pop_front() 

The standard containers std::deque and std::list satisfy these requirements.
